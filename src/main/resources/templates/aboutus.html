                                  Consulting was formed in 2000 with a simple
                                  mandate - "Offer
                                quality and professional services to the healthcare
                                industry".</span> </strong></p>
                              <p class="smlblka">Beginning as a one
                                person operation EMH Consulting began providing organizational
                                consulting services to Departments of Nursing,
                                in the Greater Toronto Area.  Word of mouth
                                of a superior service grew - it was one of the
                                few Canadian consulting firms who actually had
                                practical healthcare experience, and the operation
                                thrived. &nbsp; And so things may have continued
                                that way if it had not been for the emergence
                                of <strong>SARS </strong> in 2003. </p>
                              <p>From SARS grew a new industry of Respiratory
                                Mask Fitting companies with varying competencies.  Coming
                                from a healthcare perspective, EMH Consulting
                                was concerned with the varying competencies of
                                respirator or mask fitting services and decided
                                to do something about it! We believe we are the <strong>MOUSE
                                THAT ROARED </strong>. &nbsp; A small company
                                but with a loud voice to spread the word that
                                healthcare workers are in danger of having inadequate
                                respirator training.</p>
                              <p>In 2003 EMH Consulting launched its own respiratory
                              mask fitting program. EMH Consulting became and
                              still is the only Ontario Fit Test provider with
                              a professional health care background. &nbsp; Further,
                              it is the knowledge and skill acquired during an
                              extensive nursing career that separates us from
                              the rest and offers a far superior and more healthcare
                            specific perspective. &nbsp; </p>
